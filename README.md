##### Important

- By clicking the index.html, you would be able to run our web on the browser (chrome is recommended). However, some functions (e.g. the display of traffic map) may be unavailable.
- To migrate the problem above, please try to open the submission folder as the project folder WebStorm or VS Code, and run the index.html in there.
