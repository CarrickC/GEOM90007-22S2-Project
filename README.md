- ### GEOM90007 Group Project - Group 92

  #### ! Important Notes !

  - By clicking the index.html, you would be able to run up our web on the browser (chrome and Edge are recommended). However, certain function(s) (e.g. the display of traffic map) may be unavailable.
  - To migrate the problem above, please try to open the submission folder as the project folder in WebStorm or VS Code, and run the index.html in there. All functions would work correctly through this way.
